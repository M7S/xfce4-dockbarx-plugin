Installation instructions
-------------------------

xfce4-dockbarx-plugin uses the waf build system, and has the following
dependencies:

* Vala >= 0.36.0
* GLib >= 2.42
* GTK+3 >= 3.22
* Xfce4-Panel >= 4.12
* Xfconf >= 4.12
* DockbarX >= 1.0-beta

As Xfce's Vala bindings are typically not in repositories, they are included.

To configure, build, and install xfce4-dockbarx-plugin, run these commands:

 ./waf configure
 ./waf build
 sudo ./waf install

If you are using a distribution that supports checkinstall, you can do the
following instead of sudo ./waf install to install this in your package manager:

 sudo ./waf checkinstall

Use ./waf --help to get a list of configuration and installation options.

xfce4-panel may not detect the plugin unless you install in the /usr prefix.

 ./waf configure --prefix=/usr
