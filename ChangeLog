Change Log
----------

0.6:
- Gtk3 port (compatible with DockbarX 1.0-beta)



...


0.3.1:
- Fixed bug where DBX disappears after changing theme.
- Fixed bug where DBX restricts itself to an arbitrary size by exposing the max_size property and setting it absurdly high by default.
- Add MouseNeo themes, with -4 and -6 variants. This version has the highlight background visible on every open group button, to allow you to see open windows easier on noisy wallpapers. The highlight color and opacity can be configured. However there is no launch highlight or hover highlight anymore.

0.3:
- Modify plug to work with DBX refactoring.

0.2.1:
- Wait one second before starting DockbarX to prevent wonkiness.
- Move the plug program out of $PREFIX/bin because there's no point letting users start it outside of the plugin. On the downside... the path to that program is hardcoded, and will only go into /usr/share/xfce4/panel/plugins. I could never figure out how to get Vala defines to work in waf.
- This version is uploaded to github so others can file issues and make changes. This is no longer my baby. It is yours now, community. Raise it well. :')

0.2:
- True version that doesn't do everything in the most terrible way possible.
  "If you can't determine it gracefully, ask the user." That is a good
  programming rule.
- The DBX plug reads all configuration info from the RC file as opposed to
  having it communicated over the command line.
- Presents the configuration dialog at first run to allow the user to configure
  background styling.
- Automatically detects orientation and screen position, and communicates them
  to the DBX plug.
- Still just rudely kills off the plug whenever a configuration change occurs,
  but it works so I'm not gonna fix it.

0.1:
- Initial version with all significant functionality implemented.
